My plan is to have 3 sections to the game.  Overall, I would like to use a few aspects of gamification, and work in some sort of computational thinking puzzle.  For gamification: High score to help promote competition. Running point score which will be displayed during each game, a star value awarded for each question from 1 to 3 stars based on how well you did on that particular question.  I think I will make a max of 100 points possible per question with the possible points slowly decremented per second, and the possible points reduced for a wrong answer.  It will always be possible to get 25 points on a question. That will also help provide a reward even if you don’t fully understand what you were doing wrong. 
 
 Section 1. This section will mostly use gamification  
I will have a classroom aspect where information will be displayed to you.  You will be expected to read the information on the screen.  Then you will have a multiple-choice quiz and True/false.  So to not overwhelm It will be broken down into at least 2 different classroom information displays/multiple choice quiz’s.    
I will be using gamification During the quiz you will be awarded points based on how fast and how accurate you answer the questions.  
The information during this quiz will be focused on the basics.  It will be a high-level overview trying to focus more on universal topics, but also going over some java specific things.  Planned topics include.   
The compiler 
Java virtual machine 
JDK, JRE, and IDE 
Java byte code  
Reserved words and go over some of them 
Object-oriented programming and objects, 
Classes, and methods. 
Variables, how to declare/give initial values, them, and some of the different datatypes  
Naming Conventions 
Comments and multiline comments 
The idea of statements and syntax.  
Loops  
I might go over more stuff too not sure yet. 
 
 
Section 2. 
This section will focus on the practical aspect.  There will be a text field to enter statements.  In programming there is often many ways of doing something, but for this you will have to type in exactly what is requested.   
The first one will be some sort of hello world system out.  It will give you an example of what to type. 
There will be a few more system outs but you will be given less and less help each time.   Next you will start working with variables and putting values in them.  
After that you will be using assigned variables in system outs.   
Next will be doing basic math with variables and again displaying that. 
Next will be using loops. 
Then a combination of looping counting and system outing. 
Section 3.   
This section will be where I have the computational puzzle.  I have not decided exactly how I will do this yet.  So far I am thinking about doing something with loops.  Maybe some sort of maze that you will need to use loops to move in.    
I have not started the game yet I just started thinking about storyboard for how I would like the game to go.  I think the plan Is still text based.  I will start it this weekend.
